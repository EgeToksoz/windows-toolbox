## A little bit of backstory

This was a passion project of mine which started more than a year ago when i had to drop off my macbook to fix the plague of butterfly keyboard and there is a chance that they can reset the laptop for testing or just changing the logic board because of touch id mismatch (which happened 2 times). Which can result in lost data or lost settings and applications that have to be redownloaded. I tried mac specific solutions like Winclone but it was never stable (macos and ntfs what a great story blabla) enough for me to use it on a daily machine.

Now that i know i'm on my own i started to learn how to make backup of a windows partition then i stumbled upon another shortcoming of this t2 chip is no drivers = no keyboard/trackpad and at the time i had 2 usb hub with no usb-c flash drive so i find a way to inject those drivers at windows installer image.

And i said to myself if i want to create the ultimate toolbox wouldn't it be better if itsn't just 1 version of windows with 1 language and i added that feature and 1 year later it finally evolved to something i can comfortably use to install quickly(i mean QUICK) and now i'm sharing it as open source to make this into something amazing with full multi language support and it can save time from all our lives üòÅ
